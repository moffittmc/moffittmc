Hi, I'm Matt 👋  
I'm a Data Analyst with passionate interests in creating insights & visualizations. Dedicated to having a positive impact on the world of data. My work experiences and interests include transportation planning and aerospace & medical quality engineering in the US and the UK. 
- 👁 I’m interested in data science/analytics for good: renewable energy, nature/wildlife conservation, and climate change work are the fields I'd like to work in! Feel free to explore my repositories for my portfolio of work; hopefully there's something of interest to you. I'll also throw in the random occasional sports/music analytics project!
- ☄️ I’m currently exploring and learning more about full-stack web development - HTML/CSS/Javascript along with Node.js/Express.js/APIs/DBs and SQL.
- 💡 I’m looking to collaborate on well, anything! Hit me up! Let's build something together!
